# Unity Marching Cubes

This project was born from the desire to explore and learn about the _marching cubes_ algoritm, as presented by William E. Lorensen and Harvey E. Cline in their paper: _**Marching Cubes: A High Resolution 3D Surface Construction Algorithm. Computer Graphics, 21 (4): 163-169, July 1987**_. Implementation results are presented in real-time using the _**UnityEngine**_ (https://unity.com/) rendering pipeline and C# scripting API.

The root of the repository may be loaded as a standalone Unity project directory, complete with a _**SampleScene**_ scene file within which users may wish to customize the parameters of different implicit shapes ( or *constant density* surfaces as denoted by the algorithm developers ) in order to alter the visual outcome statically or during application lifetime.

In addition, the code itself exposes relevant __*MonoBehaviour*__ component implementations to be controlled at runtime and contains some basic optimization techniques targeted at increasing general rendering speed.
